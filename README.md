Unreal Engine plugin to allow conversion between [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) to [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).

**Editor Only Data**:
<br> In Unreal Engine 5.2 and above, editor only data has been introduced to Unreal Engine. Allowing us to import materials and material functions into our own project from the pak files of a game.

## 1. Introduction to JsonAsAsset
> Please be aware that this plugin is intended strictly for personal and educational purposes. Do not use it to create or distribute commercial products without proper licensing and permissions. It is essential to respect others' intellectual property and to use only assets you are authorized to use.

JsonAsAsset (or often referred as *`JAA`*) is a plugin to create assets from JSON data obtained from [FModel](https://fmodel.app). *`(Software for exploring Unreal Engine games)`*

We assume no responsibility for how created content may be used. However, you are free to use this tool as much as you like. Below are the supported asset types in JsonAsAsset:

###### Materials
 - Material
 - MaterialFunction
 - MaterialParameterCollection
 - PhysicalMaterial
 - SubsurfaceProfile
     
###### Curve Asset Types
 - CurveFloat
 - CurveTable
 - CurveVector
 - CurveLinearColor
 - CurveLinearColorAtlas

###### Skeleton/Animation Asset Types
 - SkeletalMeshLODSettings
 - Animation (curves, sync markers)

###### Sound Asset Types
 - SoundAttenuation
 - SoundConcurrency
 - ReverbEffect

###### Data Asset Types
- DataAsset
- DataTable

The plugin features a user-friendly interface, allowing developers to easily import JSON data and map it to appropriate data structures within Unreal Engine to create assets. This includes the ability to create curves, materials, animation curve data, and more based on the imported data. However, this plugin is not flawless, and occasional errors happen.

In this short documentation, we will learn how to use this powerful Unreal Engine plugin. And we hope you enjoy it!

## 2. Installing JsonAsAsset
> JsonAsAsset may not work for every Unreal Engine 5 version, please check Releases to see compatibility. Unreal Engine 4 is not maintained at the moment, and is not planned to be supported.
> *`(See branches for the current available Unreal Engine 4 versions)`*

1. Go to the [Releases page](/../../releases) for the plugin.
2. **Download the release** that matches your version of Unreal Engine. If there **isn't a release that matches your version**, you will need to **compile the plugin yourself**.
3. Extract the downloaded files to your project's Plugins folder. If there isn't a Plugins folder, create one in the root directory of your project.
4. Open your Unreal Engine project.
5. Click on Edit -> Plugins.
6. In the Plugins window, search for **"JsonAsAsset"** and enable it.
7. Restart the editor for the changes to take effect.

#### 2.1 Setting Up JAA Settings
> JsonAsAsset needs settings to be modified accordingly to properly handle assets. For example, the plugin has to seperate your export folder directory from the actual path to the game. 

If you haven't already, install FModel and setup it up correctly.
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./JsonAsAsset/Resources/ButtonIcon_FModel.png?raw=true">
The JSON format/file has to be from a program that fits the format of FModel's JSON export files:
<br><br>

- [FModel](https://fmodel.app) *(Software for exploring Unreal Engine games)*

-------------------

Now that you've installed FModel and setup it up correctly, we can continue to setting up JsonAsAsset for our own Unreal Engine project. Also, FModel's data is the meat and bones of the plugin, without the data being correctly the same format, the plugin won't work.

<a name="export-directory"></a>
##### 2.2 Setting up Export Directory
<img align="right" width="300" height="180" src=https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset/assets/73559984/aad4e86a-6f0b-4e66-aef1-13d30d8215de)>
Upon launching your unreal engine project, you should of seen a notification asking you to change your export directory in the plugin settings, if you've already done that, skip this part.

<br>Without changing your export directory, it will cause the plugin to crash your entire project and will make you restart. We need to change the export directory to allow the plugin to differentiate between what's your directory, and what's the game path it should put it in.

First, open up to the JsonAsAsset plugin settings (basically do what's on the picture on the right) and make sure you are looking at the property "Export Directory".

Now open up FModel, and go to your settings. `(Settings -> General)` There will be a setting called "Output Directory", copy that and go back to Unreal Engine. Now you need to click on the three dots and jump to the folder you copied and go to the folder named "Exports", then press "Select Folder".

-------------------

Thatâ€™s the basic setup! To bulk import materials or linear curve atlases (e.g., all material functions and textures), you'll need to set up [`Local Fetch`](setup-local-fetch)!

<a name="setup-local-fetch"></a>
## 3. Setting Up *Local Fetch*

Running the API requires ASP.NET 8.0 to be installed, please install this [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-8.0.2-windows-x64-installer).

> Local Fetch is a local API to assist JsonAsAsset by acting as a "FModel", and it supplies textures and asset data to import at runtime. Especially if you're wanting to import materials. It uses CUE4Parse just like FModel.
<img align="right" width="461.5" height="164" src=https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset/assets/73559984/cddf0ea7-2499-4b39-a7af-e6f27ec5148e>

#### **NOTE:** Please make sure you have the plugin in your project's directory and not in the Engine.
> The reason being is that the Local Fetch API won't be able to find your config file (settings). 

Before we can launch up Local Fetch and get started on automated references. You need to put in all the information about your game first.

This is required as CUE4Parse needs this information to setup file providers and start reading the game files. A lot of these settings are the same as FModel, however make sure you always manually selecting a file/directory using UE's file selecter.

###### Launching Local Fetch
<img align="right" width="461.5" height="250" src=https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset/assets/73559984/4688482d-0854-4a62-83cf-fc055d657284>

> You must launch Local Fetch through UE, and not by the executable file. The reason being is that the local host port is different when you launch it through UE, so it's important you do so.

After fully setting up the Local Fetch settings, you can launch the API without any issues.

-------------------

Go ahead and click on the JsonAsAsset logo (<img width="25" height="25" src=https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset/assets/73559984/b90ab71f-d9ac-4349-96eb-620aadf7812f>) and hover over the list `"Command-line Application"` and press `"Execute JsonAsAsset API (.EXE)"`.

A window should pop-up, and once the console says `[CORE] Running API`, Local Fetch has been successfully started!

## 4. Cloning JsonAsAsset

JsonAsAsset is made up of the Unreal Engine Plugin code **C++** and the Local Fetch API **(C#)**, which has CUE4Parse included aswell. This is in the [ExternalSource](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset/tree/main/JsonAsAsset/ExternalSource) folder.
